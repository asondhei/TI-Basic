This repository contains TI-Basic program codes, which can be used on TI-Basic compatible calculators. Most of these are intended to make calculators such as the TI-84 compatible with vector operations that it usually is not able to execute, as well as perform algorithmic steps for complicated engineering mechanics problems. These can also be used to rapidly solve equations and save data. These programs are only compatible with the following calculators: 
<ul>
  <li>TI-84 PLUS</li>
  <li>TI-84 PLUS CE</li>
  <li>TI-84 PLUS CE PYTHON.</li>
</ul>

# TI-Basic
<p>TI-Basic is a programming tool that can be used to write formulas, equation solvers, instructions, text, and more on a Texas Instruments graphing calculator. The software is compatible with many Texas Instruments calculators. It can be written on both calculators and computers, but it can only be implemented on calculators.</p>
<p>Since the language is programmable on the calculator, it also includes several tokens. These tokens can be calculator keys or functions, and most of them cannot be typeset on a computer. Writing programs from the computer to include these tokens often requires in-application tokens to be selected rather than typed. </p>
  
# Adding the programs to your calculator:
<ol>
  <li>Download the TI-Connect Software onto your computer.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are using a TI-84 Plus CE or a recent TI-84 Plus, you will download this application: <link> https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw. I recommend that you download this one anyways, as it allows you to see and edit the code. You can find the guidebook for the application linked here: <link> https://education.ti.com/html/eguides/connectivity/TI-Connect-CE/EN/Content/EG_Splash_Page/TI-Connect_CE_SW_84.HTML</li>
      <li>If you are using a TI-83 or older TI-84 Plus, you will download this application: <link> https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-sw </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Save the .8xp files from this repository to your computer. Make sure you are downloading from the correct folder, according to the calculator you use, otherwise you will have syntax errors. Ensure they are accessible.</li>
  <li>Launch the TI-Connect Software and plug your calculator into your computer. Make sure your calculator is turned on.</li>
    <ul><li>On the TI-Connect CE application, you can open the .8xp files from the last option in the left sidebar menu. You can also edit and create new programs here, using the functions provided in the left dropdown menu (it should look like your calculator, and is very easy to follow).</li></ul>
  <li>Send the programs to your calculator.</li>
    <uL>
      <li>On the TI-Connect CE application, there is a button of an arrow pointing to a calculator. Select that, click your device, and upload. You will do this for each program individually. </li>
      <li>On the basic TI-Connect application, click ‚ÄúSend to TI Device,‚Äù browse and select all the program .8xp files you want to send, and select the device you want to send the files to. This may take some time</li>
    </uL>
  <li>Test your programs. See instructions below on how to use your programs.</li>
</ol>

# Using your programs:
<ol>
  <li>Once you‚Äôve uploaded your programs to the calculator, select the prgm menu. Ensure that the programs appear as they are labeled on your computer.</li>
    <ul><li>If you are using a TI-84 Plus CE Python Edition, select TI-Basic.</li></ul>
  <li>You can look at the code by scrolling right to the ‚ÄúEDIT‚Äù page and selecting one of the programs.</li>
  <li>Select a program from the EXEC page to use it.</li>
  <li>Press ‚Äúenter‚Äù to initiate the program after selecting it. This should lead you to a variable prompt (I=?_) or continuation prompt.</li>
  <li>Enter your variables, and press enter after writing each variable. You cannot change the variable after entering it.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If you mistype a variable, you can quit the program by going to 2nd ü°™ quit, and the program will cancel.</li>
    <li>Operational steps such as storing variables to lists cannot be undone, if you have reached those steps in the program.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>After entering your variables for the program, you will be given either a displayed result, usable result, and/or a new prompt.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Displayed results appear before the end of the program. A displayed result can be a matrix or a scalar value. These are not always saved to memory; you will have to write them down if necessary.</li>
    <li>Usable results always come at the end of the program. These will be saved to short-term memory, meaning that you can use them as your last answer in your next operation.</li>
    <li>A new prompt can occur after a set of displays or results. Keep writing the variables needed until the program is finished.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Once your program is finished, your calculator will return to a new line. You will not be able to scroll upwards and into the program variables and inputs. The section, aside from the first line and usable result will just disappear. </li>
</ol>

# About Calculator .8xp files
Many programs use characters that don‚Äôt work if they are typeset. If you want to write your own programs, you need to select operations from the left dropdown menus in the TI-Connect CE software. DO NOT OPEN THE PROGRAMS IN A BASIC TEXT EDITOR, TERMINAL, WORD, OR ANY SIMILAR TEXT APPLICATION. The characters will be jumbled, and characters that cannot be typeset simply will not appear.
